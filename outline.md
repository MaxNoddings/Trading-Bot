# **Algorithmic Trading Bot** #

### **Objective**: Create an algorithmic trading bot that can execute strategies such as statistical arbitrage. ###

<br>

### **Key Features**: ### 
- Ability to fetch real-time market data (price, volume, etc.) from a broker or exchange.
- Implement **Statistical Arbitrage** strategies.
- Risk management and trade execution (e.g., stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing).
- Backtesting framework to test strategies against historical data.
- Real-time execution and monitoring of trades.

## **<u>Game Plan</u>** ##

### **1. Research and Select Trading Strategies** ###

**Statistical Arbitrage**:
- **Concept**: Identify and exploit inefficiencies between correlated assets (e.g., stocks, ETFs).
- **Method**: Use correlation or cointegration techniques to identify pairs of assets that move together. When one asset diverges from the other, you trade based on the assumption that they will revert to their historical relationship.
- **Tools**: Python libraries like **Statsmodels** for cointegration, **Pandas** for data manipulation.

### **2. Choose APIs and Data Providers** ###

**Broker APIs**
- **Alpaca**: Free stock trading API with commission-free trades, offers both live trading and paper trading accounts.
- **Interactive Brokers**: A professional-grade API for trading stocks, options, futures, and more.
- **Robinhood**: Offers simple API access for stock trading but with limitations.
   
**Market Data**:
- **Yahoo Finance**: Provides free historical data and can be useful for initial research and backtesting.
- **Alpha Vantage**: Free API with access to historical data and technical indicators.
- **Quandl**: Provides financial, economic, and alternative datasets, with some free options.

### **3. Set Up Development Environment**
**Programming Language**: Python (widely used for algorithmic trading due to its rich ecosystem of libraries).

**Libraries**:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and handling large arrays.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization (useful for backtesting and analyzing strategy performance).
- **Scikit-learn/TensorFlow** (optional): For machine learning models.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical tests (e.g., cointegration tests for statistical arbitrage).
- **TA-Lib**: A technical analysis library for creating indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

### **4. Data Collection and Analysis** ###
**Historical Data**: Start by collecting historical data to use for backtesting (can use free APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage for this).

**Feature Engineering**: the process of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs, called features, that can be used to improve the performance of a model or algorithm.
- For **Statistical Arbitrage**, create features based on correlation and cointegration of asset pairs.

**Visualize Data**: Plot price trends, correlation heatmaps, and moving averages to understand market behaviors.

### **5. Develop the Trading Algorithms** ###
**Statistical Arbitrage Strategy**:
- **Step 1**: Choose two assets (stocks, ETFs, or pairs) that have historically been correlated.
- **Step 2**: Test for cointegration using statistical tests (like the **Engle-Granger Test**).
- **Step 3**: Create a trading signal by calculating the spread between the two assets (e.g., `spread = price1 - price2`).
- **Step 4**: Develop a strategy where the bot goes long on one asset and short on the other when the spread diverges beyond a certain threshold, expecting reversion to the mean.
- **Step 5**: Implement stop-loss and take-profit rules to manage risk.

### **6. Backtesting Framework** ###
**Objective**: Test your strategies on historical data to see how they would have performed.

**Libraries**:
- **Backtrader**: A flexible backtesting library that supports both event-driven backtesting and live trading.
- **QuantConnect**: A cloud-based algorithmic trading platform that supports backtesting and live execution.

**Metrics to Evaluate**:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: To measure risk-adjusted return.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: To understand the worst-case scenario.
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.
- **Trade Execution Slippage**: Measure the difference between expected execution price and actual price.

### **7. Implement Real-Time Execution** ###
**API Integration**: Once your strategy is ready, integrate it with the broker's API (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.) to execute trades.

**Real-time Data Handling**: Use **WebSockets** for fast, real-time data access (order book updates, price changes).

**Execution Management**: Handle trade orders (limit orders, market orders) and monitor your open positions.

**Risk Management**: Implement stop-loss and position-sizing algorithms to ensure that you don’t overexpose yourself to risk.

### **8. Testing and Optimization** ###
**Paper Trading**: Run your bot on a simulated environment where real money isn't at risk (many brokers like Alpaca provide a paper trading mode).

**Optimization**: Tune the parameters of your strategy, such as the thresholds for opening positions or adjusting the spread.

**Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the bot’s performance in real-time, looking for any signs of failure or unexpected behavior.
