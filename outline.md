## **<u>Game Plan</u>** ##

### **1. Research and Select Trading Strategies** ###

**Statistical Arbitrage**:
- **Concept**: Identify and exploit inefficiencies between correlated assets (e.g., stocks, ETFs).
- **Method**: Use correlation or cointegration techniques to identify pairs of assets that move together. When one asset diverges from the other, you trade based on the assumption that they will revert to their historical relationship.
- **Tools**: Python libraries like **Statsmodels** for cointegration, **Pandas** for data manipulation.

### **2. Choose APIs and Data Providers** ###

**Broker APIs**
- **Alpaca**: Free stock trading API with commission-free trades, offers both live trading and paper trading accounts.
- **Interactive Brokers**: A professional-grade API for trading stocks, options, futures, and more.
- **Robinhood**: Offers simple API access for stock trading but with limitations.
   
**Market Data**:
- **Yahoo Finance**: Provides free historical data and can be useful for initial research and backtesting.
- **Alpha Vantage**: Free API with access to historical data and technical indicators.
- **Quandl**: Provides financial, economic, and alternative datasets, with some free options.

### **3. Set Up Development Environment**
**Programming Language**: Python (widely used for algorithmic trading due to its rich ecosystem of libraries).

**Libraries**:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and handling large arrays.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Visualization (useful for backtesting and analyzing strategy performance).
- **Scikit-learn/TensorFlow** (optional): For machine learning models.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical tests (e.g., cointegration tests for statistical arbitrage).
- **TA-Lib**: A technical analysis library for creating indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

---

### **5. Data Collection and Analysis**
   - **Historical Data**: Start by collecting historical data to use for backtesting (you can use free APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage for this).
   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - For **Statistical Arbitrage**, create features based on correlation and cointegration of asset pairs.
     - For **Market Making**, analyze order book data and liquidity at different price levels.
   - **Visualize Data**: Plot price trends, correlation heatmaps, and moving averages to understand market behaviors.

### **6. Develop the Trading Algorithms**

   #### **Statistical Arbitrage Strategy**:
   - **Step 1**: Choose two assets (stocks, ETFs, or pairs) that have historically been correlated.
   - **Step 2**: Test for cointegration using statistical tests (like the **Engle-Granger Test**).
   - **Step 3**: Create a trading signal by calculating the spread between the two assets (e.g., `spread = price1 - price2`).
   - **Step 4**: Develop a strategy where the bot goes long on one asset and short on the other when the spread diverges beyond a certain threshold, expecting reversion to the mean.
   - **Step 5**: Implement stop-loss and take-profit rules to manage risk.

   #### **Market Making Strategy**:
   - **Step 1**: Monitor real-time market data (order book) to place buy and sell orders.
   - **Step 2**: Calculate optimal spread to place buy orders just below the current market price and sell orders just above.
   - **Step 3**: Implement dynamic spread adjustments based on market volatility (wider spreads during high volatility, tighter during low).
   - **Step 4**: Consider risk management for dealing with price fluctuations—if the market moves too far away from the set price, the bot should cancel or modify its orders.

### **7. Backtesting Framework**
   - **Objective**: Test your strategies on historical data to see how they would have performed.
   - **Libraries**:
     - **Backtrader**: A flexible backtesting library that supports both event-driven backtesting and live trading.
     - **QuantConnect**: A cloud-based algorithmic trading platform that supports backtesting and live execution.
   - **Metrics to Evaluate**:
     - **Sharpe Ratio**: To measure risk-adjusted return.
     - **Maximum Drawdown**: To understand the worst-case scenario.
     - **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.
     - **Trade Execution Slippage**: Measure the difference between expected execution price and actual price.

---

### **8. Implement Real-Time Execution**
   - **API Integration**: Once your strategy is ready, integrate it with the broker's API (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, etc.) to execute trades.
   - **Real-time Data Handling**: Use **WebSockets** for fast, real-time data access (order book updates, price changes).
   - **Execution Management**: Handle trade orders (limit orders, market orders) and monitor your open positions.
   - **Risk Management**: Implement stop-loss and position-sizing algorithms to ensure that you don’t overexpose yourself to risk.

---

### **9. Testing and Optimization**
   - **Paper Trading**: Run your bot on a simulated environment where real money isn't at risk (many brokers like Alpaca provide a paper trading mode).
   - **Optimization**: Tune the parameters of your strategy, such as the thresholds for opening positions or adjusting the spread for market making.
   - **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the bot’s performance in real-time, looking for any signs of failure or unexpected behavior.

---

### **10. Documentation and Presentation**
   - **Code Documentation**: Write clear, concise comments and explanations for your code.
   - **Project Report**: Create a report or a blog post summarizing your approach, strategies, results, and any interesting findings.
   - **GitHub Repository**: Host the project on GitHub with a well-organized structure, including clear instructions on how to set it up and run the bot.

---

### **11. Future Enhancements (Optional)**
   - **Machine Learning**: Integrate machine learning models for predicting price movements or volatility to enhance trading decisions.
   - **Risk Management with ML**: Use ML to dynamically adjust risk parameters based on market conditions.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) to analyze news or social media data and use that to influence trading decisions.

### **Final Notes on Costs and Resources**
- **Costs**: You will likely need to pay for access to real-time market data feeds or brokerage services with API access. Some brokers charge for market data, while others (like Alpaca) offer free access to some data.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding market microstructure and order book dynamics is crucial for building a successful market-making strategy.
- **Scalability**: If the project grows and you want to deploy it on a live account, you may need a hosting solution for the bot (e.g., AWS or a VPS service), which may involve some ongoing costs.

By focusing on these strategies, you will gain experience with algorithmic trading, risk management, backtesting, and data analysis—skills that are highly valuable in the finance and quant world.
